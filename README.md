# Project Description

This project consists of a client and a server. The client is built with Next.js and does not have mobile device adaptivity but includes animations. The server is built with Node.js using Express and CORS.

The server does not utilize a database since it is a test assignment. It is a simple API server. However, if required, a database can be added in the future. For the purpose of this assignment, it was not necessary.

2. Install all client dependencies: `npm i` or `npm install`.
3. Return to the parent folder: `cd ..`.

6. Run the following command to start both the server and the client simultaneously: `npm run dev`.
